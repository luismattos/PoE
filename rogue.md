9. Rogues - Prince of Persia Blue Edition
Role: second-line damage dealer

Race: Moon Godlike. Other races can also work, but moon-moons compensate for a lot of the rogue's squishiness.

Stats (The White That Wends bonus included):

M 18
C 10
D 17
P 19
I 4
R 10

This is a pretty standard damage dealing build for 2.0. Outside of any critting/stunning attempts, intelligence is absolutely useless for the rogue so we can safely dump it. Instead, we go all out on the aggressive stats, gaining as much offensive power as possible in the process. You may even try going 8 Con, 19 dex if you want a total min-maxing. Our will is low, though, but that's nothing that a good priest can't fix.

Weapon of Choice: Sabres. Unlike the previous builds, this one is not about control - it's all the plain and powerful damage dealing. We'll have a lots of crits and dualed Resolution & Purgatory are extreme under such setup. Especially once they are upgraded by the Durgan steel.

Talents and ability choices:

1st level: Crippling Strike – our int is dumped so we won't get much out of Blinding Strikes. Crippling, on the other hand, allows us to attack twice per combat with a small bonus - it's not that significant but is better than nothing. And, with the duals, the bonus is applied to each one of them so it's 4 attacks with +25% damage on.

2nd level: Weapon Focus: Ruffian. Provides bigger bonus than the two-weapon style so we get it earlier.

3rd level: Reckless Assault - more traditional rogues go into this one early as you won't find your beloved sabres for quite a while and for generic ones Assault is much stronger.

4th level: Two-Weapon Fighting: generally, the dual wielders prefer to take Vulnerable Attack here, but it is so-so for us. For Sabres with their ungodly basic damage, it's like a 31% damage bonus. At the cost of the 10% attack loss (the actual attack). Very quickly we'll have 100% basic + 50% bonuses from the sneak attack + 20% from reckless + 24% from might = 194% in total. Vulnerable first turns this into 225%, but then takes out the 10% overall, leaving 202.5%. That's still an advantage but add some bonuses from the weapon enchanting & buffing and the difference will become rather marginal. Noticeable against ultra-high DR foes, but not everything else. Hence, you go for the Two-Weapon Fighting that just multiplies those 194% by extra 10% (so it's like 213% in effect).

5th level: Dirty Fighting - under the durgan steel, resolution & purgatory will have 130% extra critical damage bonus per hit. Now, as everything else, that applies to the basic damage of the weapon, but sabres got that ultra-high - 16 points. So crit will be extra 20.8 points of damage. In addition to the 30 or so that you'll do naturally.

6th level: Vicious Fighting.

7th level: Finishing Blow – seems to apply to both duals, so you have two strikes actually. Not many will survive through that.

8th level: Devastating Blow.

9th level: Deep Wounds or Escape or Adept Evasion. For a build with the high reflexes from maxed our Dex&Per, evasion looks much better.

10th level: Bull's Will or Bloody Slaughter – let's either fix our feeblemindedness a bit or become even better against heavily wounded foes.

11th level: Deathblows. That smokey distraction thing is even more useless for us because of the 3 Int.

12th level: Mental Fortress or Bloody Slaughter.

13th level: Sap or something you hadn't taken at level 9. Without intelligence, Sap devolves into a 30% damage bonus for one strike – at this stage of the game, that barely matters. Only filler choices here.

14th level: More defenses, I think. Both physical or magical are fine. Shadowing Beyond may work too, just as the escape mechanism.
